ddrutility - Tool set to aid in data recovery

Ddrutility is a toolset designed to help aid in data recovery using GNU
ddrescue. It contains the following programs:

Ddru_findbad - Utility for finding what files are related to bad sectors. For
more info on ddru_findbad, try 'ddru_findbad --help'.

Ddru_ntfsbitmap - Utility to extract the bitmap file from a NTFS partition, and
then create a domain log file to use with ddrescue that would only recover the
used portion of the partition. For more info on ddru_ntfsbitmap, try
'ddru_ntfsbitmap --help'.

Ddru_ntfsfindbad - Utility for NTFS partitions to find which files are related
to bad sectors in a ddrescue log file. You should use this for NTFS partitions
in place of the original ddru_findbad. For more info on ddru_ntfsfindbad, try
'ddru_ntfsfindbad --help'.

Ddru_diskutility - Advanced LINUX ONLY utility that can perform several
different functions on a disk, using some direct pass-through disk commands. For
more info on ddru_diskutility, try 'ddru_diskutility --help'.
