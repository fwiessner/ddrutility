ddrutility THANKS file

ddrutility has originally been written by Scott Dwyer.

Thanks to all that have helped by reporting bugs, and supplying ideas.

Special thanks to Nicholas Sperling for supplying a small C program to work with
my original test proccessbitmap bash script. While none of his original code
exists in ddrutility, the idea inspired me to learn C programming.

Thanks to olegkrutov for pointing out and helping with issues processing the
NTFS file system.

Thanks to Christian Franke for supplying modifications to configure.ac for
better compatibility, and for supplying a patch for ddru_findbad so it no longer
relies on the BASH shell.

And of course, thanks to Antonio Diaz Diaz for creating and maintaining GNU
ddrescue, and putting up with my ideas and modifications.
